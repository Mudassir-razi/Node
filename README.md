This is a project that i thought of for a very long time
This is a very basic circuit simulator.
Nothing has been done yet.
For starters, it's gonna simulate only linear, purely resistive, independent sources, steady state, DC circuit.
After this, I will try to add dependent sources and eventually other passive components and other analysis.
